> Hiya guys!
>
>Patrick (patio11) here. You're getting this email from me because you asked for my occasional thoughts（偶尔的想法） on making and selling software. 
>
>Edit: Actually, it's possible that you've never gotten an email from me. Somebody might have just given you the link to this page, which is an online archive of an email that I sent to folks（人们） who had asked for it. If you'd like to get articles like this in your inbox, totally free, about once a week or two, ![give me your email address.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)
>
>Usually I concentrate more on the needs of established（已建立的）software businesses, but recently I've been asked for some advice by people who are still in the trenches（在战壕里） working at a traditional day job.
>
>There's absolutely nothing wrong with day jobs. Most people have them. They're an honest living. Some people really enjoy the particular one that they have. If your day job is right for you, that is wonderful and I will not second-guess your decision.
>
>Many people nurse dreams of entrepreneurship（怀揣创业梦想，nurse：护理/培养，entrepreneurship：企业家能力） because their day job is not quite right for them. Here's my story.
>
>I used to be a salaryman（工薪族） at a Japanese megacorporation（特大企业）. The social expectation is that the company insulates（隔离，使孤立） the employee from all risk, and in turn, the employee swears themselves body and soul to the company.
>
>I worked 70 to 90 hour weeks for three years. This isn't particularly out of the ordinary（普通的，平常的） for white collar（白领） employees in Japan. It didn't strike（打击） me while I was a salaryman that I was going to continue doing it until retirement, largely because the amount of work was killing me, and I worked after those hours on my own projects.
>
>Somebody asked me recently how I managed to stay motivated（有积极性的） to work for the 91st through 95th hours every week. Answer: because I wanted to end the week with something.

> ### Applied Capitalism For Fun And Profit
>
>I'm a capitalist（资本家）. A friend of mine is a devoted（忠实的） Marxist（马克思主义者）. I think we mutually（互相地） agree that, considering any particular employee, it is in that employee's personal interest（be in one's personal interest：符合个人利益） to stop selling hours of labor（劳工，劳动） and start renting access to his accumulated（累积的） capital（资本） as soon as humanly（在人力所及的范围内） possible.
>
>I don't mean just monetary（财政的，货币的） capital -- having $100,000 in your 401k is awesome but that's not the type which is really interesting to me, simply because rates of return on that sort of capital are so low. There are many types of capital that are no less real just because you can't conveniently reduce them to a number.
>
>Human capital -- the skills you've built up over time and the value you're able to create as a result of them.
>
>Social capital -- the ability to call on someone who trusts you and have them do something in your interest, like e.g. recommend you to a job.
>
>Reputational capital -- the way your name rings out in rooms you aren't even in, simply when your topic of expertise comes up. (Hopefully in a good way!)
>
>A lot of day jobs（日常工作） structurally inhibit（抑制） capital（资本） formation（形成）. If I were a Marxist I'd say "And this is an intended（打算中的） consequence（结果） of Capital's desire（欲望） to keep Labor（劳工） subservient（顺从的） to it", but I honestly think it's true even without anybody needing to twirl（旋转） their mustache（胡子）.

>There's a great line from Jack Welch to the effect of "You work for a week, collect your paycheck on Friday, and then you and the company are even." Corporate America has embraced it with a vengeance. I'm too young to remember an America where "company loyalty" wasn't a punch line.
