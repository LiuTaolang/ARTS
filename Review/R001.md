> Hiya guys!
>
>Patrick (patio11) here. You're getting this email from me because you asked for my occasional thoughts（偶尔的想法） on making and selling software. 
>
>Edit: Actually, it's possible that you've never gotten an email from me. Somebody might have just given you the link to this page, which is an online archive of an email that I sent to folks（人们） who had asked for it. If you'd like to get articles like this in your inbox, totally free, about once a week or two, ![give me your email address.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)
>
>Usually I concentrate more on the needs of established（已建立的）software businesses, but recently I've been asked for some advice by people who are still in the trenches（在战壕里） working at a traditional day job.
>
>There's absolutely nothing wrong with day jobs. Most people have them. They're an honest living. Some people really enjoy the particular one that they have. If your day job is right for you, that is wonderful and I will not second-guess your decision.
>
>Many people nurse dreams of entrepreneurship（怀揣创业梦想，nurse：护理/培养，entrepreneurship：企业家能力） because their day job is not quite right for them. Here's my story.
>
>I used to be a salaryman（工薪族） at a Japanese megacorporation（特大企业）. The social expectation is that the company insulates（隔离，使孤立） the employee from all risk, and in turn, the employee swears themselves body and soul to the company.
>
>I worked 70 to 90 hour weeks for three years. This isn't particularly out of the ordinary（普通的，平常的） for white collar（白领） employees in Japan. It didn't strike（打击） me while I was a salaryman that I was going to continue doing it until retirement, largely because the amount of work was killing me, and I worked after those hours on my own projects.
>
>Somebody asked me recently how I managed to stay motivated（有积极性的） to work for the 91st through 95th hours every week. Answer: because I wanted to end the week with something.

> ### Applied Capitalism For Fun And Profit
>
>I'm a capitalist（资本家）. A friend of mine is a devoted（忠实的） Marxist（马克思主义者）. I think we mutually（互相地） agree that, considering any particular employee, it is in that employee's personal interest（be in one's personal interest：符合个人利益） to stop selling hours of labor（劳工，劳动） and start renting access to his accumulated（累积的） capital（资本） as soon as humanly（在人力所及的范围内） possible.
>
>I don't mean just monetary（财政的，货币的） capital -- having $100,000 in your 401k is awesome but that's not the type which is really interesting to me, simply because rates of return on that sort of capital are so low. There are many types of capital that are no less real just because you can't conveniently reduce them to a number.
>
>Human capital -- the skills you've built up over time and the value you're able to create as a result of them.
>
>Social capital -- the ability to call on someone who trusts you and have them do something in your interest, like e.g. recommend you to a job.
>
>Reputational capital -- the way your name rings out in rooms you aren't even in, simply when your topic of expertise comes up. (Hopefully in a good way!)
>
>A lot of day jobs（日常工作） structurally inhibit（抑制） capital（资本） formation（形成）. If I were a Marxist I'd say "And this is an intended（打算中的） consequence（结果） of Capital's desire（欲望） to keep Labor（劳工） subservient（顺从的） to it", but I honestly think it's true even without anybody needing to twirl（旋转） their mustache（胡子）.
>
>There's a great line from Jack Welch to the effect of "You work for a week, collect your paycheck on Friday, and then you and the company are even（公平的）." Corporate（企业） America has embraced（接受） it with a vengeance（报复）. I'm too young to remember an America where "company loyalty（忠诚度）" wasn't a punch line（口号）.
>
>If company loyalty were a bankable（富有号召力的） proposition（提案） (and it might still be at some places -- I know a smaller company or two where "we treat our employees like family" means exactly what it says on the tin（罐头盒）), you'd get a wee（极小的） bit of capital every week you worked. That's one more week towards your boss' good impression of you. One more week towards your pension. One more week towards that gold watch.
>
>Japanese salarymen still have that sort of arrangement.
>
>At some point at my ex-employer, I realized that I couldn't possibly work at a salaryman job until retirement, because it was going to be the death of me. (I won't belabor（痛批） that period of my life because it was pretty rough（艰难）, but suffice（使...合格) it to say if you pull 6 months of 90 hour weeks, towards the end of it the periodic（周期的） blackouts（停电） start to get a little distressing（令人苦恼的）.)
>
>Once I came to the conclusion that I'd probably quit（辞职）, and therefore discounted（不全信） the till-your-death-do-us-part slow accumulation of firm-specific capital, I realized something which is fundamentally true of a lot of day jobs. Nothing I did at the job mattered, in the long run.
>
>Sure, in the short run, I was writing XML files and Java classes which, knock on wood, successfully let my employers ship（交付） an examination management system to their client（客户） (a major university). I was a really effective Turing machine which accepted emails and tickets as input and delivered (occasionally) working code and Excel files as output. But no matter how much I spun（旋转）, nothing about my situation ever changed. I worked my week, got to the end of it, and had nothing to show. The next week there would be more emails and more tickets, exactly like the week before. The week after that would be more of the same. And absolutely nothing about my life would change. I'd end the week with nothing.
>
>**Don't end the week with nothing**. Prefer to work on things you can show. Prefer to work where people can see you. Prefer to work on things you can own.
>
>### Prefer Working On Things You Can Show
>
>One of the reasons developers have embraced OSS so much is because it gives you portable capital between companies: if your work is sitting on Github, even if you leave one job, you can take it with you to your next job. Previously this happened pretty widely but generally under the table. (Is there any programmer who does not have a snippets folder or their own private library for scratching that one particular itch?) One of the great wrinkles that OSS throws into this is that OSS is public by default, and that's game changing.
>
>Why? Because when your work is in public, you can show it to people. That's often the best way to demonstrate that you're capable（能干的） of doing work like it.
>
>Telling people you can do great work is easy: any idiot can do it, and many idiots do. Having people tell people you do great work is an improvement. It suffers because measuring individual productivity on a team effort is famously difficult, and people often have no particular reason to trust the representations（陈述） of the people doing the endorsements（背书）.
>
>(Quick: if you had credible evidence that a mid-level engineering manager at a company you've never heard of in Nagoya thought I was a really effective employee, would that make you markedly（显著地） more likely to hire me? Right, without the context of knowing him, that recommendation is almost useless.)
>
>Work you can show off（炫耀，卖弄）, though, is prima（第一的） facie evidence of your skills. After your portfolio（文件夹） includes it, your ability to sell your skills gets markedly better. Given that most people's net worth（净价值） is almost 100% invested in their personal capital (i.e. if you're a young engineer the net present value of all future salary absolutely swamps（使陷入困境） everything in your bank account), this is a fairly radical（根本的） improvement in your present situation for not a very radical change in how you go about things.
>
>Thus my first piece of advice: if you have the choice between multiple jobs, all else being equal, pick the one where you are able to show what you've worked on. This could mean working on a language stack where work biproducts are customarily（习俗上） OSSed (e.g. Rails) versus one which isn't (e.g. C#). This could mean working on particular projects within the organization which like external（外部的） visibility (e.g. Android) rather than projects which don't (e.g. AdWords plumbing -- presumably Google will pay you a lot of money to do that, but consider it compensation（补偿金） for not being able to talk about it). This could mean working in industries which default to being open rather than those which default to being closed.
>
>OSS isn't nearly the only way to be able to show what you've worked on. In the creative industries, where the end product is customer-visible, people keep very close eye on whose name ends up in the credits. Academics（学术） spend lots of time worrying about citation（引用） counts and directed graphs.
>
>More prosaically（散文式地，平凡地）, establish（建立） an expectation early that you're simply going to talk about what you're doing. I think at Fog Creek / Stack Exchange they call this "producing artifacts（史前古物）" -- conference presentations（学术报告）, blog posts, OSSed software, and the like, centered around the work. Even at very open companies there exists lots of secret sauce（调味酱）, but most of the valuable work of the company is not particularly sensitive, and much of it has widely generalizable lessons. Write about those lessons as you learn them. If at all possible, publish what you write. Even if it is published to an audience of no one, you will be able to point people back to it later.
>
>Some of my most effective writing in terms of career growth was back in 2006 through 2008, when I was struggling through not understanding anything I was doing, and where I -- quite literally -- had less readers than my younger brother's blog on writing superhero novels. Why was toiling in Internet-obscurity still valuable? Because I was able to point to particular experiments that I started in e.g. 2008, and then point to the followups in 2009 and 2010, which showed those experiments were really successful. The failures and false starts aren't extremely interesting to most people, but having some successes under your belt credibly demonstrates that you're capable of either reproducing them in the future or experimenting your way to new successes in your new environment.
>
>If you cannot build things you can show at work, you should build things you can show outside of work. Companies in our industry are gradually becoming more reasonable about IP assignment clauses -- there's less of the "we own everything you think of at any point in your employment" nonsense these days. Even at my very straight-laced Japanese megacorp, they were willing to write an exception into the employment contract for a) OSS work that I did outside of company hours and b) Bingo Card Creator. I offered them this in exchange: "If you let me continue working on these, I'm going to learn lots of skills which I can put to the use of the company. Normally you invest lots of money sending engineers to conferences and professional training. This is even better for you: I'll learn more with no operating expenditure and no decrease in billing efficiency." That's an offer you can make to substantially any employer.
>
>I prefer being upfront with people rather than doing the "It is easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission" route a lot of folks suggest. Sure, you can just roll the dice and pretend your employer is unlikely to notice your side project. Unfortunately, the odds of them noticing your side project go up sharply if the side project is ever successful, and then your lack of forthrightness about it give you unbounded liability extending far into the future. Just ask. The worst they can say is "No."
>
>You might consider asking in the context of a more general compensation discussion than just "Hey boss, can I work on OSS?" That way, if they say "No side projects", you'll say "OK, in lieu of the side projects, I'll need more money." It's easier to be sticklers for the stock agreements when there's absolutely no cost to the company to insist on the usual boilerplate, but minor concessions on the boilerplate are often easier than concessions on things which actually appear on the company's books.
>
>### Prefer To Work Where People Can See You
>I used to phrase this as "work in public", but when people think about folks who work in public, they think of rock stars and figure "Well, I'll never be a rock star."
>
>Vanishingly（难以察觉地） few people in our industry have the profile of rock stars. They can still have substantial（坚实的) profile（外型） among the audience of "people professionally relevant to them." That might be as tightly scoped as "people with hiring authority for front-end developers in my metro area", which might be a set of, what, a couple of dozen folks?
