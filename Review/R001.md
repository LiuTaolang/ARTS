> Hiya guys!
>
>Patrick (patio11) here. You're getting this email from me because you asked for my occasional thoughts（偶尔的想法） on making and selling software. 
>
>Edit: Actually, it's possible that you've never gotten an email from me. Somebody might have just given you the link to this page, which is an online archive of an email that I sent to folks（人们） who had asked for it. If you'd like to get articles like this in your inbox, totally free, about once a week or two, ![give me your email address.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)
>
>Usually I concentrate more on the needs of established（已建立的）software businesses, but recently I've been asked for some advice by people who are still in the trenches（在战壕里） working at a traditional day job.
>
>There's absolutely nothing wrong with day jobs. Most people have them. They're an honest living. Some people really enjoy the particular one that they have. If your day job is right for you, that is wonderful and I will not second-guess your decision.
>
>Many people nurse dreams of entrepreneurship（怀揣创业梦想，nurse：护理/培养，entrepreneurship：企业家能力） because their day job is not quite right for them. Here's my story.
>
>I used to be a salaryman（工薪族） at a Japanese megacorporation（特大企业）. The social expectation is that the company insulates（隔离，使孤立） the employee from all risk, and in turn, the employee swears themselves body and soul to the company.
>
>I worked 70 to 90 hour weeks for three years. This isn't particularly out of the ordinary（普通的，平常的） for white collar（白领） employees in Japan. It didn't strike（打击） me while I was a salaryman that I was going to continue doing it until retirement, largely because the amount of work was killing me, and I worked after those hours on my own projects.
>
>Somebody asked me recently how I managed to stay motivated（有积极性的） to work for the 91st through 95th hours every week. Answer: because I wanted to end the week with something.

> ### Applied Capitalism For Fun And Profit
>
>I'm a capitalist（资本家）. A friend of mine is a devoted（忠实的） Marxist（马克思主义者）. I think we mutually（互相地） agree that, considering any particular employee, it is in that employee's personal interest（be in one's personal interest：符合个人利益） to stop selling hours of labor（劳工，劳动） and start renting access to his accumulated（累积的） capital（资本） as soon as humanly（在人力所及的范围内） possible.
>
>I don't mean just monetary（财政的，货币的） capital -- having $100,000 in your 401k is awesome but that's not the type which is really interesting to me, simply because rates of return on that sort of capital are so low. There are many types of capital that are no less real just because you can't conveniently reduce them to a number.
>
>Human capital -- the skills you've built up over time and the value you're able to create as a result of them.
>
>Social capital -- the ability to call on someone who trusts you and have them do something in your interest, like e.g. recommend you to a job.
>
>Reputational capital -- the way your name rings out in rooms you aren't even in, simply when your topic of expertise comes up. (Hopefully in a good way!)
>
>A lot of day jobs（日常工作） structurally inhibit（抑制） capital（资本） formation（形成）. If I were a Marxist I'd say "And this is an intended（打算中的） consequence（结果） of Capital's desire（欲望） to keep Labor（劳工） subservient（顺从的） to it", but I honestly think it's true even without anybody needing to twirl（旋转） their mustache（胡子）.
>
>There's a great line from Jack Welch to the effect of "You work for a week, collect your paycheck on Friday, and then you and the company are even（公平的）." Corporate（企业） America has embraced（接受） it with a vengeance（报复）. I'm too young to remember an America where "company loyalty（忠诚度）" wasn't a punch line（口号）.
>
>If company loyalty were a bankable（富有号召力的） proposition（提案） (and it might still be at some places -- I know a smaller company or two where "we treat our employees like family" means exactly what it says on the tin（罐头盒）), you'd get a wee（极小的） bit of capital every week you worked. That's one more week towards your boss' good impression of you. One more week towards your pension. One more week towards that gold watch.
>
>Japanese salarymen still have that sort of arrangement.
>
>At some point at my ex-employer, I realized that I couldn't possibly work at a salaryman job until retirement, because it was going to be the death of me. (I won't belabor（痛批） that period of my life because it was pretty rough（艰难）, but suffice（使...合格) it to say if you pull 6 months of 90 hour weeks, towards the end of it the periodic（周期的） blackouts（停电） start to get a little distressing（令人苦恼的）.)
>
>Once I came to the conclusion that I'd probably quit（辞职）, and therefore discounted（不全信） the till-your-death-do-us-part slow accumulation of firm-specific capital, I realized something which is fundamentally true of a lot of day jobs. Nothing I did at the job mattered, in the long run.
>
>Sure, in the short run, I was writing XML files and Java classes which, knock on wood, successfully let my employers ship（交付） an examination management system to their client（客户） (a major university). I was a really effective Turing machine which accepted emails and tickets as input and delivered (occasionally) working code and Excel files as output. But no matter how much I spun（旋转）, nothing about my situation ever changed. I worked my week, got to the end of it, and had nothing to show. The next week there would be more emails and more tickets, exactly like the week before. The week after that would be more of the same. And absolutely nothing about my life would change. I'd end the week with nothing.
>
>**Don't end the week with nothing**. Prefer to work on things you can show. Prefer to work where people can see you. Prefer to work on things you can own.

>One of the reasons developers have embraced OSS so much is because it gives you portable capital between companies: if your work is sitting on Github, even if you leave one job, you can take it with you to your next job. Previously this happened pretty widely but generally under the table. (Is there any programmer who does not have a snippets folder or their own private library for scratching that one particular itch?) One of the great wrinkles that OSS throws into this is that OSS is public by default, and that's game changing.
>
>Why? Because when your work is in public, you can show it to people. That's often the best way to demonstrate that you're capable（能干的） of doing work like it.
>
>Telling people you can do great work is easy: any idiot can do it, and many idiots do. Having people tell people you do great work is an improvement. It suffers because measuring individual productivity on a team effort is famously difficult, and people often have no particular reason to trust the representations（陈述） of the people doing the endorsements（背书）.
