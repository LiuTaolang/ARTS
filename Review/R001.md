> Hiya guys!
>
>Patrick (patio11) here. You're getting this email from me because you asked for my occasional thoughts（偶尔的想法） on making and selling software. 
>
>Edit: Actually, it's possible that you've never gotten an email from me. Somebody might have just given you the link to this page, which is an online archive of an email that I sent to folks（人们） who had asked for it. If you'd like to get articles like this in your inbox, totally free, about once a week or two, ![give me your email address.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)

>Usually I concentrate more on the needs of established（已建立的）software businesses, but recently I've been asked for some advice by people who are still in the trenches（在战壕里） working at a traditional day job.
>
>There's absolutely nothing wrong with day jobs. Most people have them. They're an honest living. Some people really enjoy the particular one that they have. If your day job is right for you, that is wonderful and I will not second-guess your decision.
>
>Many people nurse dreams of entrepreneurship（怀揣创业梦想，nurse：护理/培养，entrepreneurship：企业家能力） because their day job is not quite right for them. Here's my story.
>
>I used to be a salaryman（工薪族） at a Japanese megacorporation（特大企业）. The social expectation is that the company insulates（隔离，使孤立） the employee from all risk, and in turn, the employee swears themselves body and soul to the company.
>
>I worked 70 to 90 hour weeks for three years. This isn't particularly out of the ordinary（普通的，平常的） for white collar（白领） employees in Japan. It didn't strike（打击） me while I was a salaryman that I was going to continue doing it until retirement, largely because the amount of work was killing me, and I worked after those hours on my own projects.
>
>Somebody asked me recently how I managed to stay motivated（有积极性的） to work for the 91st through 95th hours every week. Answer: because I wanted to end the week with something.
