> Hiya guys!

>Patrick (patio11) here. You're getting this email from me because you asked for my occasional thoughts(偶尔的想法) on making and selling software. 
>
>Edit: Actually, it's possible that you've never gotten an email from me. Somebody might have just given you the link to this page, which is an online archive of an email that I sent to folks(人们) who had asked for it. If you'd like to get articles like this in your inbox, totally free, about once a week or two, ![give me your email address.](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)

>Usually I concentrate more on the needs of established(已建立的) software businesses, but recently I've been asked for some advice by people who are still in the trenches(在战壕里) working at a traditional day job.
